<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p>Reactions affect solute and solid model species differently.</p>
<p>The solid model species are the same occurring in the chemical reaction equations. Therefore they are affected directly according to the reaction stoichiometry.</p>
<p>Solute model species are either component-totals (e.g.&nbsp;DIC, TOT_P, …) to be speciated later or species on their own (e.g.&nbsp;O2, CH4). The effect of reactions on solute species is first formulated for the species occurring in the chemical reaction equations according to the reaction stoichiometry. In a second step this changes are translated to changes of the component-totals / model species using a translation table.</p>
</section>
<section id="transport" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transport">Transport</h3>
<p>For solutes the (probably) dominant species of a component-total governs the diffusion coefficient (cf code-block “Diffusion Coefficients”). The transport of solids is not affected by species properties.</p>

<li>Solve steady state without equilibrium solver. All reactions are controlled by component-totals. If necessary, pH dependent speciation is estiamted based on <strong>???</strong></li>
